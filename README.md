# Welcome to gShell!

## PowerShell Cmdlets for G Suite Administration
gShell is a toolset to help you access and manage information from your G Suite (formerly Google Apps) domain through [Windows PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell). ([Need some help with the basics](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/PowerShell-Basics)?)
Simply put, gShell is a native PowerShell wrapper for the APIs that make up the [Google Admin SDK](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/).

### What's New?
Version 0.10 beta is now available! With [50 new cmdlets](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Cmdlets-Index) added, you can't go wrong! This is the final major update to gShell. [Check out the News page for more,](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/News) or dive in to the comprehensive [wiki](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki)!

Check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Getting-Started) page to get going, or hop over to [Downloads](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Downloads) if you want to dive in with the installer.

#### Quick Examples
The idea of gShell is to allow you quick and easy access to your G Suite domain. Check out some of the following examples to see how this can be helpful to you, once you get past the [quick setup](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Getting-Started).

- Easily [retrieve a user](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Get-GAUser) from your domain:

```PowerShell
PS C:\> Get-GAUser BMcGee

GivenName     : Bobby
FamilyName    : McGee
PrimaryEmail  : bmcgee@mydomain.com
Aliases       : {bobbymcgee@mydomain.com, bobmcgee@mydomain.com}
Suspended     : False
OrgUnitPath   : /
LastLoginTime : 2013-10-25T05:10:40.000Z
```
- Get all users in the domain as a variable:

```PowerShell
PS C:\> $AllUsers = Get-GAUser -all

----
PS C:\> $AllUsers.Count

9001
```

- Get a list of all members in a [Google group](https://github.com/squid808/gShell/wiki/Get-GAGroupMember):

```PowerShell
PS C:\> $Members = Get-GAGroupMember SomeGroupName

----
PS C:\> $Members.Count

42
```
- Export members of all groups in to a CSV:

```PowerShell
PS C:\> $AllMembers = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList

foreach ($Group in (Get-GAGroup -All)) {
    if ($Group.DirectMembersCount -gt 0) {
        $Members = Get-GAGroupMember $Group.Email

        foreach ($Member in $Members) {
            $Member | Add-Member -NotePropertyName "Group" -NotePropertyValue $Group.Email
            $AllMembers.Add($Member) | Out-Null
        }
    }
}

----
PS C:\> $AllMembers[0]

Group : songcharacters@mydomain.com
Email : bobbymcgee@mydomain.com
ETag  : "01...rs/44...HQ"
Id    : 123456789123456789123
Kind  : admin#directory#member
Role  : MEMBER
Type  : USER

----
PS C:\> $AllMembers | Export-Csv -Path "C:\AllGroupMemberships.csv" -NoTypeInformation

----
PS C:\> (Get-Content "C:\AllGroupMemberships.csv")[0..1]
# Let's look directly at the CSV file...

"Group","Email","ETag","Id","Kind","Role","Status","Type"
"songcharacters@mydomain.com","bobbymcgee@mydomain.com",
"""01...rs/44...HQ""","12...23","admin#directory#member","MEMBER","USER"

```
